Recently I had not been in touch with my blog and  forgot the whole process of using my blog in a new machine. 
I have learnt from this page.
```
http://blog.zerosharp.com/clone-your-octopress-to-blog-from-two-places/
```
or this

```
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20765692/how-to-setup-octopress-if-you-already-have-one-in-github
```
 I am just writing it down in case i forgot again.
