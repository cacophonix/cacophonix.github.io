* Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once.
* Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.
* Not the same, but related.
* Concurrency is about structure, parallelism is about execution.
* Concurrency provides a way to structure a solution to solve a problem that may (but not necessarily) be parallelizable.
* Concurrency is a way to structure a program by breaking it into pieces that can be executed independently.
